# SML-Projects
SML algorithms implemented on the datasets

Naive_Bayes__Logistic_regression Folder:
Parameter estimation of given MNIST image dataset using Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression, compared their re-sulting accuracy of 69% and 49% respectively.

K_Means_Clustering folder:
Implementation of K-Means clustering on dataset, which contains set of 2D points. Implemented with 2 startegies, and with clusters ranging from 2-10.

CNN folder:Convolution Neural Network on images from MNIST dataset using Google CoLab. Test was implemented with 3 strategies and each achieveing over 98% test accuracy.
